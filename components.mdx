## Purpose-built API Gateway

* Access control, API key management and consumption control.

Our cloud edge API gateway proxies API calls to your backend, controls access, enforces plan limitations for your users and automatically tracks per-customer usage.

It is globally distributed, so your customers always connect to the closest Nadles instance, getting the lowest latency and increased throughput.

## Billing engine

* Billing and subscriptions.

Our billing engine manages the whole life cycle of user subscriptions and turns usage data collected by the API gateway into amounts due to be paid by the users of your API.

The billing engine is built on a flexible data model, which enables a huge variety of pricing models to be implemented. Even if the payment service provider doesn't support certain features, Nadles makes it possible. Contact [support@nadles.com](mailto:support@nadles.com) to receive assistance in setting up your pricing model.

## Payment provider integration

* Payment processing

Our ready-made payment provider integrations allow you to immediately start accepting payments for subscriptions from customers all over the world without writing a single line of code.

We also offer a Merchant of Record option which takes care of handling the VAT/Sales tax/GST.

Nadles Billing Engine makes sure you get paid on time, in accordance with the pricing model you configured.
