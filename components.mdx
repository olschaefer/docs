## Purpose-built API Gateway

* Access control, API key management and consumption control.

Our cloud edge API gateway proxies API calls to your backend, controlling access and enforcing plan limitations for your users while automatically tracking per-customer usage.

Your customers always connect to the closest Nadles instance, getting the lowest latency and increased throughput.

## Billing engine

* Billing and subscriptions.

Our intelligent billing engine takes care of the entire subscription lifecycle for your users. It transforms the usage data captured by the API gateway into accurate invoices, ensuring your customers are billed precisely for the services they consume.

The Nadles billing engine is built on a highly adaptable data model. This allows for the implementation of a wide range of pricing strategies, exceeding the capabilities often provided by standard payment service providers. 

Even if your chosen payment service provider lacks specific features, Nadles makes it possible. Contact [support@nadles.com](mailto:support@nadles.com) to receive assistance in setting up your pricing model.

## Payment provider integration

* Payment processing

Ready-made payment provider integrations allow you to immediately start accepting payments for subscriptions from customers all over the world without writing a single line of code.
