## Purpose-built API Gateway

**Access control, API key management and usage control**

The Nadles API Gateway sits at the cloud edge, proxying requests to your API backend while managing access, enforcing subscription limits, and automatically tracking usage per customer.

With global edge locations, your users are always routed to the nearest Nadles instance—ensuring minimal latency, higher performance, and a seamless API experience.

## Billing engine

**Automated billing and subscription management**

The Nadles Billing Engine handles the full subscription lifecycle, turning usage data collected by our API gateway into precise, reliable invoices. Your customers are billed accurately based on what they actually use.

Built on a flexible and extensible data model, the Nadles Billing Engine supports advanced pricing strategies that go beyond what typical payment providers offer.

Even if your payment provider is missing certain features, Nadles fills the gaps to ensure your billing setup works exactly the way you need.
