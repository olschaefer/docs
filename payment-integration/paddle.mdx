## Overview

Paddle integration is another option offered by Nadles for payment collection.

[Paddle](https://paddle.com/) is a payment solution provider serving as [Merchant of Record](https://www.paddle.com/blog/what-is-merchant-of-record).

Using a merchant of record allows you to collect payments internationally without the need to care about different taxation rules between countries.

Nadles adds missing usage-based billing functionality to Paddle: it records usage data for each subscription and creates corresponding charges in Paddle, so that customers are correctly billed for the actual usage at the end of each billing period.

<Info>
In contrast to API marketplaces, Nadles doesn't act as a middleman in the payment process.

All payments are made directly to your Paddle account.

## Prerequisites

* Active Paddle account
* [SaaS taxable category](https://www.paddle.com/help/start/intro-to-paddle/why-do-i-need-to-select-'taxable-categories'-for-my-products) approved for your account by Paddle
* Your own domain name [approved by Paddle](https://www.paddle.com/help/start/account-verification/what-is-domain-verification)
* If you're **NOT** using this domain for your user portal on Nadles, you also need an [overlay checkout page](#setting-up-checkout-page) set up on your own domain


## Setting up Paddle account

For Nadles to successfully manage your Paddle products and subscriptions, the following data is required:

* Your Paddle seller ID
* API key
* Webhook secret key

Nadles stores this information in encrypted form, you won't be able to see it again once it's saved.

Follow the steps below to obtain the necessary credentials.

### API key and seller ID
* On Nadles, navigate to **My User Portal → Payment integration**.
* Open Paddle in a new tab and navigate to **Developer tools → Authentication**.
* Copy your seller ID into the **Your Paddle vendor ID** field on Nadles.
* Click **Generate API Key**.
* Enter `Nadles` as key name.
* Copy the generated key into the **API key** field on Nadles.

### Webhook

* On Paddle, navigate to **Developer tools → Notifications**.
* Click **New destination**.
* Enter `Nadles` as description.
* Select **Notification type** `Webhook`.
* Copy the endpoint URL from the field **Your Paddle webhook URL** on Nadles into the **URL** field on Paddle.
* Check the **Select all events** checkbox.
* Click **Save destination**.
* After that, click **Edit destination** and copy the webhook signing secret into the **Webhook secret key** field on Nadles.
* Save the Paddle integration form on Nadles.

## Setting up payment page

Paddle requires you to set up a checkout page on your own domain where customers will enter payment details and finish the payment.

### In Nadles User Portal

If you enabled Nadles User Portal for your account and attached a custom domain to it,
you can use a pre-built payment page provided by Nadles.

* Make sure the custom domain that you attached to the user portal is approved in your Paddle account.
* On Paddle, navigate to **Developer tools → Authentication**.
* Click **Generate client-side token**.
* Enter `Nadles` as name.
* Click **Generate** and copy the generated token.
* Navigate to **Checkout → Checkout settings**.
* In the field **Default payment link** enter
  
  `https://<user-portal-domain>/consumer/checkout/paddle/<generated-client-side-token>`

* Done. Now Paddle will redirect your customers to the payment page provided by Nadles.
* Don't forget to customize the style of your Paddle checkout form to match the user portal. For that, navigate to **Checkout → Checkout settings → Inline**.

### On your website

If you aren't using Nadles User Portal or didn't attach a custom domain to it, you can create a payment page on your website.
Nadles will redirect your customers to this page for payment.

In order to accept payments via Paddle, you need to build an [overlay checkout page](https://developer.paddle.com/build/checkout/build-overlay-checkout) that [accepts Paddle transaction ID](https://developer.paddle.com/build/transactions/pass-transaction-checkout) and host it on your domain.

The overlay checkout page can be as simple as a single HTML page with a bit of JS code.

Let's say you own the domain name `myfirstapi.example` and plan to host the Paddle checkout page on `https://myfirstapi.example/paddle-checkout`

Follow the steps below to get your Paddle checkout up and running.

#### Domain verification

First, get `myfirstapi.example` approved by Paddle. [What is domain verification?
](https://www.paddle.com/help/start/account-verification/what-is-domain-verification)

#### Default payment link

Second, set up your [default payment link](https://developer.paddle.com/build/transactions/default-payment-link) on Paddle to:

`https://myfirstapi.example/paddle-checkout`

Nadles will redirect your customers to this page to make a payment.

Two query string parameters will be added to the URL:

1. `_ptxn` — a checkout transaction ID, added by Paddle. [Learn more.](https://developer.paddle.com/build/transactions/create-transaction)
2. `_px_success_url` — success URL, added by Nadles. Paddle will redirect the customer to this URL after the payment succeeds.


#### Paddle checkout page

Third, build the checkout page and host it on your website.

Feel free to use the following template and customize as needed:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.7.1.min.js" integrity="sha256-/JqT3SQfawRcv/BIHPThkBvs0OEvtFFmqPF/lYI/Cxo=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.paddle.com/paddle/v2/paddle.js"></script>

<script type="text/javascript">
  Paddle.Environment.set("sandbox"); // replace with "production" before going live
  Paddle.Setup({ 
    token: '7d279f61a3499fed520f7cd8c08' // replace with your client-side token
  });

  $(function() {
    var urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);

    Paddle.Checkout.open({
          transactionId: urlParams.get('_ptxn'),
          settings: {
            theme: "light",
            locale: "en",
            successUrl: urlParams.get('_px_success_url')
        }
    });
  });
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

Now deploy the page on `https://myfirstapi.example/paddle-checkout` and you're good to go.

That's it. Paddle integration is set up and ready.
