## Overview

[Stripe](https://stripe.com/) integration is one of two options offered by Nadles for payment collection.

Nadles Billing Engine is fully integrated with Stripe and all you need to do in order to start accepting payments is to set up a Stripe account and configure Nadles.

You don't have to create products/prices/customer accounts in Stripe — Nadles does that automatically.

<Info>
In contrast to API marketplaces, Nadles doesn't act as a middleman in the payment process.

All payments are made directly to your Stripe account.
</Info>

Nadles Billing Engine automatically calculates amounts due, initiates payments and tracks the status of each payment in order to enable or disable access for customers to your API.

Nadles doesn't use Stripe Billing. All amounts are calculated by Nadles Billing Engine and turned into Stripe invoices.

For each subscription that uses Stripe as payment provider, Nadles automatically creates Stripe invoices and attempts automatic payment collection. If the attempt fails, the customer can pay the invoice manually.
