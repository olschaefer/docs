## Overview

Pricing page displays your selected products including prices, descriptions, and "Subscribe" buttons.

It also replaces the default index page in your user portal that users see when they have no active subscriptions.
That eliminates the need for customers to return to your website from the user portal to select the product to subscribe, which makes the subscription process smoother and increases your conversion rate.


## Public pricing page

The pricing page is also available to non-authenticated users.

If you want to add a pricing page link to your website, use the following URL:

```
https://<your-user-portal-domain>/pricing/
```

## Embedded pricing page

If you would like to embed the product list in your website, use the following URL:

```
https://<your-user-portal-domain>/pricing/embedded/
```

This removes all elements other than the product list from the pricing page.

```
<iframe
    src="https://<your-user-portal-domain>/pricing/embedded/"
    frameborder="0" 
    width="100%" 
    height="330px" 
    style="overflow: hidden;"
></iframe>
```
