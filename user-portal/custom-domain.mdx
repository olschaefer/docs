## General

You can attach a custom domain name to your Nadles User Portal, so that, instead of Nadles domain (`https://<subdomain>.up.nadles.com/`), users access your portal by the domain name owned by you.

<Note>
Attaching your own domain updates checkout link URLs to point to your user portal.
</Note>

In order to successfully complete the setup, you must be able to edit DNS records of the domain name.

## Setting up a custom domain name

To start, navigate to **My User Portal → Settings**.

Enter the domain name you'd like to use for your user portal in the **Custom domain name** section.

By clicking **Submit** you initiate a domain ownership verification process.

## Ownership verification

To verify ownership, you need to add two DNS records.

* TXT record for the base domain with a unique value generated by Nadles.

* CNAME record for the desired subdomain referencing the Nadles domain name for user portals, `up.nadles.com`.

In this example we're attaching `app.myfirstapi.com`, so the two records to add to `myfirstapi.com` are:

| Type  | Name | Value                                      |
| :---- | ---- | ------------------------------------------ |
| TXT   | @    | nadles\_verification\_8KcfbFwYGieHpqTY8... |
| CNAME | app  | up.nadles.com                               |

After you've added the records, click **Check DNS propagation status** and make sure that the records have propagated to the majority of the servers.

Then click **Verify DNS records** to make Nadles verify the ownership and issue a SSL certificate.

And your custom domain name is displayed everywhere instead of the standard URL assigned by Nadles.
