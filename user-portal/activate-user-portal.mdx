## Overview

Nadles offers you a hosted white-label user portal where your customers can manage their subscriptions, payment methods, track usage and payment history.

See the [demo user portal](https://app.demoapiprovider.eu/) in dark colors.

To make Nadles invisible to your customers, you need to enable the user portal, apply your business style to it and attach custom domains to the API and user portal.

This is useful when you have a landing page in your corporate style and would like to ensure a seamless user experience.

## Prerequisites

* You need a Google Recaptcha V3 site and secret key. Google Recaptcha is used to protect the registration form from bot sign ups.

## Activating user portal

* Navigate to **My User Portal â†’ Settings**.
* Enter the subdomain for your user portal.

  By default, Nadles domain `https://<subdomain>.up.nadles.com` is assigned to your user portal. Later you can attach your own domain to it.

* Enter Recaptcha site and secret keys in the respective fields.
