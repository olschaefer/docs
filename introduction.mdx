## What is Nadles

Nadles is a carefully designed collection of integrated cloud components built specifically to allow for effortless API monetization. With Nadles you don't need to write any code in order to start selling your API.

## Purpose-built API Gateway

* Access control, API key management and consumption control.

Our cloud edge API gateway proxies API calls to your backend, controls access, enforces plan limitations for your users and automatically tracks per-customer usage.

It is globally distributed, so your customers always connect to the closest Nadles instance, getting the lowest latency and increased throughput.

## Proprietary billing engine

* Billing and subscriptions. We can do what Stripe and Paddle can't.

Our billing engine manages the whole life cycle of user subscriptions and turns usage data collected by the API gateway into amounts due to be paid by the users of your API.

The billing engine is built on a flexible data model, which enables a huge variety of pricing models to be implemented. Even if the payment service provider doesn't support certain features, Nadles makes it possible. Contact [support@nadles.com](mailto:support@nadles.com) to receive assistance in setting up your pricing model.

## Payment provider integration

* Payment collection

Our ready-made payment provider integrations allow you to immediately start accepting payments for subscriptions from customers all over the world without writing a single line of code.

We also offer a Merchant of Record option which takes care of handling the VAT/Sales tax/GST.

Nadles Billing Engine makes sure you get paid on time, in accordance with the pricing model you configured.

## User portal

* Customer onboarding, subscription dashboard, checkout pages

Nadles offers a hosted user portal for your customers where they can manage their subscriptions and track their usage.

Nadles Checkout Links allow you to onboard your customers, presenting your API products in the best way optimized for conversion.

You can apply custom styling to your user portal and checkout pages, in order to build trust with customers and ensure seamless experience for them, preserving your corporate identity.
