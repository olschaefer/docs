**Nadles is the complete platform for API monetization**, built for developers who want usage-based billing, clean customer experiences, and full control without building everything from scratch.

Whether you're launching your first public API or scaling a global product, Nadles gives you the tools to handle:

🔐 Access control – Enforce API key authentication and usage limits at the edge.

💳 Billing – Real-time, usage-based pricing with one-time charges, retries, and flexible plans.

🧾 Subscriptions – Hosted customer portal, branded checkout, and subscription management.

🌍 Global delivery – Low-latency, high-throughput API gateway infrastructure.

All of it is designed to work out of the box, without locking you into rigid patterns.
