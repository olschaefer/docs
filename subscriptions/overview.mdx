Subscription lifecycle on Nadles begins with creating an order.

When a customer clicks **Subscribe** on the checkout page, Nadles creates an order which expires in 24 hours if not paid.

Before taking the customer to the payment page, Nadles collects billing address to make sure invoices are issued correctly.

After a successful payment, the customer is returned to the subscription dashboard where all details about pricing, current usage and included API endpoints are displayed:

On the subscription page, the customer can

* Manage API access keys.
* Update payment method.
* View the full transaction history.
* Switch the subscription to a different product, if that is allowed by the configuration.
* Top up prepaid items, if allowed.
* Cancel subscription.


## Cancellation

Subscriptions are not canceled immediately. When the user clicks **Cancel subscription**, the cancellation is scheduled for the nearest billing date.
This helps avoid unnecessary refunds.
