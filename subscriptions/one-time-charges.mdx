## Overview

The Nadles Billing Engine allows API providers to create one-time charges within an existing subscription. This feature gives you more flexibility in managing billing scenarios that go beyond regular recurring payments.

## When to Use One-Time Charges

One-time charges can be used in situations such as:

- **Retrying a failed payment**: If a customer's recurring charge fails, you can create a one-time charge to reattempt collection without modifying the subscription cycle.
- **Advance payment for high usage**: If a customer's API usage exceeds expected limits before the end of the billing period, you can issue an additional charge to cover the extra cost in real time.

This capability helps API providers maintain revenue continuity and manage usage-based pricing more dynamically.

## How It Works

One-time charges are linked to an existing subscription and are processed through the Nadles Billing Engine. The charge is added on top of the regular recurring billing and appears as a separate line item on the customerâ€™s invoice.

You can trigger these charges from the subscription product dashboard in your API provider control panel.
