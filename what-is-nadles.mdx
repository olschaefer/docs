Nadles is a collection of integrated cloud components built specifically to allow for effortless API monetization.
With Nadles you don't need to write any code in order to start selling your API.

## Purpose-built API Gateway

*<sub>Access control, API key management and consumption control</sub>*

Our cloud edge API gateway proxies API calls to your backend, controls access, enforces plan limitations for your users and automatically tracks per-customer usage.

It is globally distributed, so that your customers always connect to the closest Nadles instance, getting the lowest latency and increased throughput.

## Proprietary billing engine

##### Billing and subscriptions

Our billing engine manages the whole life cycle of user subscriptions and turns usage data collected by the API gateway into amounts due to be paid by the users of your API.

The billing engine is built on a flexible data model, which enables a huge variety of pricing models to be implemented. Even if the payment service provider doesn't support certain features, Nadles makes it possible.
