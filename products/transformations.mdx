## Overview

Transformations allow you to dynamically modify requests and responses. That includes headers, query string parameters and body.

Product-scoped transformations are applied to requests/responses only if the customer is subscribed to this product.

<Tip>
  Transformations defined on an API level are always applied first.

  Read about [API-scoped transformations](/api-management/transformations).
