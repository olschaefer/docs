* Navigate to **Products → choose a product → Limits**.

* Click **Add rate limit**.

  A rate limit can be specified per N seconds/minutes/hours.

* Configure the new rate limit.

  Rate limits can be applied to several endpoints. In that case, the rate limit will be shared by the group of endpoints.
  The endpoints can be from different APIs, the rate limit will work regardless.

### Max burst

An additional number of requests accepted in case the rate limit was exceeded by the user.

#### Max burst example
Rate limit: 1 req/s, max burst: 5

If 7 requests hit the Nadles API Gateway at the same moment, the first six requests are passed without a delay, and the last, seventh request is rejected. All subsequent requests are also rejected until the rate of 1 req/s is achieved.
