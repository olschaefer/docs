## Service headers

Nadles adds the following headers to each authenticated request proxied to your API:

* `X-Billing-Subscription-Id` — unique subscription ID.
* `X-Billing-Customer-Id` — unique customer ID, this field can have the same value for different subscriptions.
* `X-Billing-Request-Id` — unique request ID.

You can use these headers for tracing and monitoring purposes.

## Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

Setting correct CORS headers needs to be done in the API itself.

By default, Nadles passes all unauthenticated OPTIONS requests to your API backend. Make sure to return correct headers in response to those requests.

## User IP

The actual user IP is the first IP address in the `X-Forwarded-For` header.

E.g. if the header looks like

```
X-Forwarded-For: 77.123.24.12,8.8.9.9,31.31.31.31
```

then `77.123.24.12` is the actual IP of the user making the API call.

## Stored information

Nadles stores the following information about each request and response:

* Request and response headers
* Request URL
* Subscription-related IDs
* Usage data for quotas
* Timings
* Response status code

It does not store or log request or response bodies.
