title: 'Custom domain'
---

You can attach a custom domain name to an API served via Nadles API Gateway, so that, instead of Nadles domain (like `https://<subdomain>.p.nadles.com/`), users access your API by the domain name owned by you.

<Warning>
  In order to successfully complete the setup, you must be able to edit DNS records of the domain name.
