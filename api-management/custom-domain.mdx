title: 'Custom domain'

You can attach a custom domain name to an API served via Nadles API Gateway, so that, instead of Nadles domain (like `https://<subdomain>.p.nadles.com/`), users access your API by the domain name owned by you.

<Warning>
  In order to successfully complete the setup, you must be able to edit DNS records of the domain name.

## Setting up a custom domain name

<Accordion title="Short video" defaultOpen={false} icon="video" />

To start, navigate to **APIs → choose an API → API Settings**.

Scroll the page down to the **Custom domain name** section.

Here, enter the domain name you'd like to use for your API.

By clicking "Submit" you initiate a domain ownership verification process.

## Ownership verification

To verify ownership, you need to add two DNS records.

* TXT record for the base domain with a unique value generated by Nadles

* CNAME record for the desired subdomain referencing the Nadles API Gateway's domain name, `p.nadles.com`.

In this example we're attaching `api.myfirstapi.com`, so the two records to add to `myfirstapi.com` are:





| Type  | Name | Value                                      |
| ----- | ---- | ------------------------------------------ |
| TXT   | @    | nadles\_verification\_8KcfbFwYGieHpqTY8... |
| CNAME | api  | p.nadles.com                               |
