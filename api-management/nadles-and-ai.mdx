The Nadles API Gateway fully supports `text/event-stream` responses, making it ideal for AI applications such as streaming responses from language models or delivering real-time inference results.

You can also proxy SSE streams to your users without additional configuration, which is perfect for use cases like live updates, notifications, or progress feeds.
