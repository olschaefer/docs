## Overview

Transformations allow you to dynamically modify requests and responses. That includes headers, query string parameters and body.

This section describes API-scoped transformations. 
Transformations defined on an API level are applied to requests/responses to that API, regardless of the product the customer is subscribed to.


<Tip>
  Transformations defined on an API level are always applied first.

  Read about [product-scoped transformations](/products/transformations).

One of the use-cases for transformations is to authenticate Nadles API Gateway in your API backend by API key. Learn how to [configure Nadles to send an API key to your backend](/api-management/securing-your-backend).
