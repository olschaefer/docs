Nadles issues API keys automatically.

When a subscription is activated, a new API key is issued and available to the customer in the self-service portal.

Whenever the subscription gets canceled or unpaid, Nadles revokes all API keys automatically.

You can always issue additional keys for your customers and revoke the existing ones on the subscription management page.

To manage keys for a subscription, navigate to **Customers → choose customer → Subscriptions → choose subscription**.
