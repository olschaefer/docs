**Name**

The name of your API. This name your customers will see on the checkout page.

**Base URL**

The base URL for all API endpoints.

The full URL to which Nadles API Gateway will proxy users' requests, is formed as `Base URL + Endpoint URL`.

<Info>
  If your API has the following endpoints:

  `https://api.mydomain.com/weather-forecast/`
  `https://api.mydomain.com/current-weather/`

  then `https://api.mydomain.com/` is the base URL.
</Info>

<Warning>
  Do not add path parameters or query string to the base URL of your API. That can be done using "Transformations".

## Nadles Gateway settings

By default, your API is accessible on Nadles domain and the access URL looks like `https://<subdomain>.p.nadles.com/`

Later, you can configure Nadles API Gateway to use a custom domain for your API, e.g. [`https://api.mydomain.com`.](https://api.mydomain.com.) [Learn more](api-management/custom-domains).

* Click "Submit".

* After the API is added, you are redirected to the dashboard.

* On the dashboard there is now the Nadles API URL that should be used by your customers to make requests to the API.

To attach a custom domain to your API, check out [this page](api-management/custom-domains).
