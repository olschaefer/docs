## General settings

**Name**

The name of your API. This name your customers will see on the checkout page.

**Base URL**

The base URL for all API endpoints.

The full URL to which Nadles API Gateway will proxy users' requests, is formed as `Base URL + Endpoint URL`.

<Info>
  If your API has the following endpoints:

  `https://api.mydomain.com/weather-forecast/`
  `https://api.mydomain.com/current-weather/`

  then `https://api.mydomain.com/` is the base URL.
</Info>

<Warning>
  Do not add path parameters or query string to the base URL of your API. That can be done using "Transformations".
</Warning>

## Nadles Gateway settings

### API subdomain

By default, your API is accessible on Nadles domain and the access URL looks like `https://<subdomain>.p.nadles.com/`

Later, you can configure Nadles API Gateway to use a custom domain for your API, e.g. [`https://api.mydomain.com`.](https://api.mydomain.com.) [Learn more](api-management/custom-domains).

* Click "Submit".

* After the API is added, you are redirected to the dashboard.

* On the dashboard there is now the Nadles API URL that should be used by your customers to make requests to the API.

### Authentication instructions for API users

This is a textual description of how your API users should authenticate when making API calls. The text will be shown to your customers on the checkout and subscription pages.

By default, Nadles Gateway expects the access token to be sent in the `X-Billing-Token` header.

This behavior can be changed: you can flexibly configure Nadles Gateway to look for the access token in any other header (including the standard `Authorization: Bearer` scheme) or in an arbitrary field in JSON request body.

If you decide to configure user authentication differently, make sure to update the **Authentication instructions for API users** field.

See the [Authentication](api-management/authentication) chapter of this documentation to learn more.

## Custom domain name

Nadles allows attaching custom domain names to your API, so that instead of the default `https://<subdomain>.p.nadles.com/` URL, customers use your own domain name to make API calls.

Read more about that in the [Custom domain name](https://docs.nadles.com/api-management/custom-domains/) section of this documentation.
