You can add a new API in two ways: by importing an OpenAPI specification or manually.

## From OpenAPI file

Nadles supports importing OpenAPI **v3.0** specifications. It is the easiest way to get your API up and running.

* Click **"Import OpenAPI file"**.

* Choose the subdomain for your API, select the OpenAPI file and click **"Submit"**.

<Info>
  By default, Nadles let's you choose a subdomain for your API, so the URL to access your API looks like `https://<subdomain>.p.nadles.com/`

  Later, you can configure Nadles API Gateway to use a custom domain for your API, e.g. `https://api.mydomain.com`. [Learn more](https://docs.nadles.com/api-management/custom-domains/).
</Info>

The OpenAPI definition is imported along with all endpoints. If there are several elements in the "servers" array, the first one is used. After importing, please check the correctness of the configuration on the API Settings page.

## Manually

### Adding a new API

* On the API list page click **"Add new API"**.

* Fill in the details of the API.

**Name**

The name of your API. This name your customers will see on the checkout page.

**Base URL**

The base URL for all API endpoints.

The full URL to which Nadles API Gateway will proxy users' requests, is formed as `Base URL + Endpoint URL`.

<Info>
  If your API has the following endpoints:

  `https://api.mydomain.com/weather-forecast/`
  `https://api.mydomain.com/current-weather/`

  then `https://api.mydomain.com/` is the base URL.
</Info>

<Warning>
  Do not add path parameters or query string parameters to the base URL of your API. That can be done using "Transformations".
</Warning>

**Short description**

Shown to your customers on the checkout page if no full description is provided.

**Full description**

Shown to your customers on the checkout page.

**Link to your Terms of Service**

Link to your website page with the Terms of Service for your API. Shown to your customers on the checkout page.

**Link to your API documentation**

Link to your website page with the API documentation. Shown to your customers on the checkout page.

**API subdomain**

By default, your API is accessible on Nadles domain and the access URL looks like `https://<subdomain>.p.nadles.com/`

Later, you can configure Nadles API Gateway to use a custom domain for your API, e.g. [`https://api.mydomain.com`.](https://api.mydomain.com.) [Learn more](api-management/custom-domains).

* Click "Submit".

* After the API is added, you are redirected to the dashboard.

* On the dashboard there is now the Nadles API URL that should be used by your customers to make requests to the API.

To attach a custom domain to your API, check out [this page](api-management/custom-domains).

### Adding endpoints

Go to **"Endpoints"** section and click **"Add new endoint"**.

Choose a HTTP method and enter the endpoint URL relative to the base URL.



<Info>
  If your API has the following endpoints:

  `https://api.mydomain.com/weather-forecast/`
  `https://api.mydomain.com/current-weather/`


  then `https://api.mydomain.com` is the base URL and `/weather-forecast/` and `/current-weather/` are the endpoint URLs.
</Info>

Path parameters can be used in endpoint URLs. These parameters can be used later to configure billable metrics, request transformations and rejection rules.



<Info>
  You can specify endpoint URLs like this:

  `GET /weather-forecast/{city}`


  In this case, you will be able to configure Nadles API Gateway to limit access to weather forecast for certain cities or charge different amounts for different cities.
