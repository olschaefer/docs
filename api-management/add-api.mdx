You can add a new API in two ways: by importing an OpenAPI specification or manually.

## From OpenAPI file

Nadles supports importing OpenAPI **v3.0** specifications. It is the easiest way to get your API up and running.

* Click **"Import OpenAPI file"**.

* Choose the subdomain for your API, select the OpenAPI file and click **"Submit"**.



<Info>
  By default, Nadles let's you choose a subdomain for your API, and the URL to access your API looks like `https://<subdomain>.p.nadles.com/`

  Later, you can configure Nadles API Gateway to use a custom domain for your API, e.g. `https://api.mydomain.com`. [Learn more](https://docs.nadles.com/api-management/custom-domains/).
</Info>



The API definition is imported along with all endpoints. If there are several elements in the "servers" array, the first one is used. After importing, please check the correctness of the configuration on the API Settings page.
