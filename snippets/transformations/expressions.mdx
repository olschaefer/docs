### JavaScript

You can use JavaScript expressions in your transformations to make them even more dynamic.

Expressions must evaluate to a new string value for the header/query string parameter/body.

#### Examples

<Info>
    **Example â€” News API**
    Say, you provide an API endpoint that returns contents of a news article. E.g.,

    ```json
    {
        "id": "b6355c53-44a3-464b-bc9e-759749cdb3ec",
        "title": "The title",
        "content": "Some long article body"
    }
    ```

    For your "Free" product, you'd like to return only the first 120 characters of article body.

    With the following transformation added to the "Free" product, you configure Nadles API Gateway to do that:

    ![](/img/product-modeling/transformations/transformations-js-expression-example.png)

    Note that the expression evaluation result is used as the **new value** for the response body.
</Info


<Note>
    If the original request or response body was compressed using GZip, Deflate or Brotli encoding, Nadles will compress the replaced body as well.
</Note>


#### Expression variables

There are several variables you can use in your expressions.
