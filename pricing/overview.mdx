## Features

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Recurring subscriptions" icon="repeat" iconType="sharp-solid">
        Regular subscriptions allow you to periodically bill your customers for provided services at any arbitrary schedule.
    </Accordion>


    <Accordion title="Prepaid models" icon="gas-pump">
        Prepaid models allow your customers to buy a certain amount of
        [billable metrics units](/products/billable-metrics) and use them until running out of balance.

        A good example is, your customers buy 1000 credits, use them and top up as needed.

        Another example is a Trial plan with 500 API calls included. Once the customer makes 500 requests, Nadles revokes access.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Pay as you go" icon="gauge">
        Nadles API gateway and billing engine work together to track usage per subscription,
        periodically aggregate the usage data, calculate and bill amounts due.
    </Accordion>


    <Accordion title="Mixed billing periods" icon="calendar-range">
        You can combine several prices with different billing intervals in a single subscription.

        It's easier to illustrate with an example.
        Let's say, you would like to offer an annual plan with overages paid monthly.
        
        E.g.,
        
        * \$400 a year
        * 5000 API calls per month included
        * $0.1 overage, billed monthly

        With Nadles, implementing this kind of pricing can be done with several mouse clicks.
    </Accordion>


    <Accordion title="Separate billing and usage aggregation schedules" icon="calendars">
        Sometimes you'd like to record usage more often and collect a payment once in a while.
        You can do so by setting different billing and usage aggregation periods.

        For example, you can configure Nadles to aggregate usage daily and bill for the accrued amount once a month.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Arbitrary one-time charges" icon="money-bill-1">
        Are you noticing unusually high usage from a customer and worried their upcoming payment might fail?
        
        Has a customer's recurring payment already failed and is now overdue?
        
        Do you want to reduce the risk of non-payment by charging a specific amount in advance?

        Nadles lets you issue one-time charges of any amount, while automatically adjusting the customerâ€™s next billing cycle to reflect those charges.


    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Combination of all the above" icon="circles-overlap">
        By combining different kinds of pricing and billing rules you can create complex pricing scenarios that fit your business model.
